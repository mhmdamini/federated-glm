**Federated GLM** is a Python package for simulating **federated learning** with **generalized linear models (GLMs)**. It supports Gaussian, Binomial, and Poisson families, and allows flexible experimentation with elastic net regularization, client data partitioning, and convergence diagnostics.

---

## 🔧 Features

- Federated learning framework with `average` or `weighted` aggregation
- Supports **Gaussian**, **Binomial**, and **Poisson** GLM families
- Elastic Net, Lasso, and Ridge regularization (proximal updates)
- Utilities for synthetic data generation and partitioning across clients
- Model evaluation with R², RMSE, accuracy, Poisson deviance, etc.
- Examples for comparing centralized and federated learning
- Simple API and complete test coverage

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/mhmdamini/federated-glm.git
```

To install with development or example dependencies:

```bash
pip install "federated-glm[dev]"
pip install "federated-glm[examples]"
```

## 🛠 Quick Start

Here’s a minimal example using Gaussian regression:

```python
from federated_glm import PersonalizedFederatedGLM, FederatedLearningManager, DataGenerator, ModelEvaluator

# Generate synthetic data
X, y, family = DataGenerator.generate_glm_data("gaussian", n=200, p=3)

# Split train/test
X_train, X_test = X[:150], X[150:]
y_train, y_test = y[:150], y[150:]

# Partition data across clients
client_data = DataGenerator.partition_data(X_train, y_train, n_clients=3)

# Train a federated model
manager = FederatedLearningManager()
manager.fit(client_data, family, n_rounds=10)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = manager.predict(X_test, family)
metrics = ModelEvaluator.evaluate(y_test, y_pred, "gaussian")

print("R² Score:", metrics["r2_score"])
print("RMSE:", metrics["rmse"])

```

For personalized federated learning, it will be:

```python
pfed = PersonalizedFederatedGLM(method='pfedme')
pfed.fit(client_data, family, n_rounds=20)
```
Where method can be 'pfedme', 'perfedavg', and 'local_adaptation'.
